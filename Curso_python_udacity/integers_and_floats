#print(5/0)
# what happens when we try to divide by zero?  Let's find out!  Uncomment the line above and run the code to see what happens.  You should see an error message that looks something like this:
#Traceback (most recent call last):
# "/tmp/vmuser_tnryxwdmhw/quiz.py", line 1, in <module>
 #   print(5/0)

#ZeroDivisionError: division by zero```

#Traceback means "What was the programming doing when it broke"!   This part is usually less helpful than the very last line of your error.  Though you can dig through the rest of the error, looking at just the final line `ZeroDivisionError`, and the message says we divided by zero. Python is enforcing the rules of arithmetic! 
#In general, there are two types of errors to look out for

#* **Exceptions**
#* **Syntax**

#An **Exception** is a problem that occurs when the code is running, but a 'Syntax Error' is a problem detected when Python checks the code before it runs it.  For more information, see the Python tutorial page on [Errors and Exceptions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html).
